I have chosen to choose my own scenario, I would like to make a database for a banking institution where people can withdraw and deposit
money from their accounts, where an officer oversees the manager, transactions, and creates accounts and loan accounts.

5 questions:
1.) Does customer X have multiple accounts open, is so what kind of accounts?
2.) Does customer X have any unpaid debt this month?
3.) Is there any customer with an overdrafted account today?
4.) How many checking or saving accounts were open this past week?
5.) Does customer x make a deposit of x amount of dollars?


Buisness Rules:
1.) If any account is overdrafted and is not paid for by the end of the day charge an extra $5.
2.) Every account must have a name, address, and social.
3.) Must be 18 years or older to open up a checkings account.
4.) A customer cannot have more than 3 accounts.
5.) Customers must pay an annual fee of $10 to keep their account opened.
