My database pretty much simulates a banking insitution in which data from
customers, transactions, managers, and officers are stored into their own
tables so they can be used to analyze to improve perfomance, to charge
people yearly for using their bank or monthly on their loan accounts. The 
database can also help the company be more effiecient in the way where they
can check to see how long each customer is taking for each deposit, withdraw 
or time spent on an appointment. I have made it so that the officer oversees 
the manager and trascations and creates both accounts and loan accounts, while
the manager approves loan accounts and manages the loan table. Each account 
has a loan account that check to see if they late on their monthly loan account
and if they are they can get charged an extra $5 a day from when their payment
was due. Every customer, employee and officer must have some type of ID. A
customer has a customer ID, a manager and officer both have a employee ID.
